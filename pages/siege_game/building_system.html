						The building system in the game consists of two tilemap grids. The first 
						of the two grids is the permanent building grid. It has to be filled with 
						white and red tiles, white tiles represent available spaces and red tiles 
						represent obstructed spaces. The second grid is the temporary building 
						grid which is empty. Whenever the building button is pressed 
						(Q by default) both grids are rendered and a menu will appear from the 
						bottom of the screen containing all the buildings available with their 
						respective costs. The building previews can be clicked, when doing so 
						the preview will start following the mouse snapping to the grid.

						<br><br>

						<span class="image right">

						</span>

						The system will check for the necessary conditions of the selected building 
						(available materials, building place validity and available spaces) if one 
						of them is incorrect it will paint the surrounding area of the temporary 
						grid in red, otherwise if all conditions are proper it will color the area 
						green. When the user left clicks the building will be placed, Initialized 
						and passed to the building manager so it can be updated every frame.
						
						<br><br>

						<span class="image left">
							<img src="../../images/Siege_Game/placed_building.png" alt="Building Grid Image" />
						</span>

						After a building is placed, the system will paint the area occupied by the 
						building red on the permanent building grid, so next time the user tries 
						to place a new building, the area where there are already buildings will 
						detected by the system as an invalid position and won't allow another 
						building to be placed in this position. This is to avoid building 
						superposition which would break the game.

						</span>

						Buildings in this game are modular, when you have a placed wall modules 
						of buildings like the ballista can be stacked on top. For this to work I 
						implemented a valid position system that marks where a building can be 
						placed. Two raycasts on the bottom of the selected building will detect 
						what type of position is under the selected building. For example the 
						wall requires to be placed on the ground so it will only be placeable 
						when both raycasts detect ground beneath it.

						<br><br>

						<span class="image right">
							<img src="../../images/Siege_Game/ballista_corner_invalid.png" alt="Building Grid Image" />
						</span>

						<br><br>

						The reason why there are two raycasts instead of just one is to avoid 
						placing a building when they are halfway on top of a wall. If only one 
						raycas was being checked the position of the image here could be valid. 
						By placing one raycast in each corner checking if the element bellow is 
						a valid spot, only the correct posistion perfectly on top will be valid.

						<br><br>

						</span>

						<span class="image left">
							<img src="../../images/Siege_Game/wall_ballistas.png" alt="Building Grid Image" />
						</span>
						<br>
						
						This way the ballista will be only placeable on top of a wall, 
						the ballista itself is also a "wall" valid position, so you can 
						stack modules as much as you want. This gives the player the ability 
						to modify is playstyle by combining various types of buildings to 
						deffend themselves from the hordes of enemies.
